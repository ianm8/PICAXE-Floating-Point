# PICAXE-Floating-Point
32 bit and 64 bit floating point routines for PICAXE microcontrollers.
These routines add basic floating point operations to PICAXE microcontrollers. Although the underlying format used is IEEE 754, actual calculations do not fully conform to the standard. For example, there is no specific implementaon of infinite, NaN or subnormal numbers. Use at your own risk.
